a typical Bonehead experience like? Will I fit in?</p>

</div>
<div style="width: 380px; text-align: left; float: left; margin-left: 10px;">
<p style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">How are
the Boneheads different from the other sections?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"> You mean aside from playing
the trombone?<br>
<br>
Perhaps more than any other section, we have a unique culture that
complements but is separate from NUMB. We have band camp, rehearsal,
and game-day traditions, relics that are passed down from previous
generations, and a long history of creativity that's left a strong mark
on NUMB. Our <a href="funandtraditions.html">traditions
and cultural identity</a> date back as far as the oldest senior
can remember and are a big part of the Bonehead experience.<br>
<br>
Besides that, the Boneheads are an active social group outside of
marching band season. We have weekly dinners, Chicago-area adventures,
the Bonehead Bowl (our annual Boneheads vs. the World football game),
and plenty of other fun activities. </p>
<p style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Will I
fit in?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"> Yes!<br>
<br>
There's no "typical" Bonehead, so don't worry if you don't have
anything in common with the <a href="members.html">current
members</a>. Boneheads come from all across the country, major in
just about anything, and have an incredibly varied musical background.
Nothing is "normal" other than a good attitude and a willingness to
have fun!<br>
<br>
Not only that, but if something isn't working for you, it's easy to
find a way to fix it. Since NUMB is the smallest Big Ten band, we get
to know one another, both in the whole ensemble and in the trombone
section. If you have ideas to change things or make things better,
we'll definitely be willing to listen in a way that's not possible in a
band with 50 trombones. </p>
<p style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">What
other benefits are there to being a Bonehead?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"> 1.) A guarantee that you'll
have lots of fun.<br>
<br>
That's really one of our top goals. Whether it's a Bonehead movie
night, hilarious e-mails over the listserv, a late-night Nintendo Wii
party, or any of our game-day traditions, you'll have a great time.<br>
<br>
2.) Access to amazing alumni.<br>
<br>
NUMB as a whole greatly benefits from a strong <a href="http://alumni.northwestern.edu/numbalums/">alumni
network</a>, but the Bonehead alumni are truly fantastic. Many
participate on the section listserv, attend most home games (not just
Homecoming), join us for section events, and, when necessary, might
even take care of you if you get <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H1N1">H1N1
influenza</a>! They've always got great stories and good advice
for getting through Northwestern successfully.<br>
<br>
3.) Unparalleled admiration from your peers and superiors.<br>
<br>
A typical conversation might go something like this:<br>
<br>
<b>Professor:</b> You seem to be an unusually happy,
physically fit, and spirited Northwestern student. I can only assume
you're in the marching band. What instrument do you play?<br>
<b>You:</b> Why, in fact, you are correct! I play the
trombone-- we're affectionately referred to as the Boneheads.<br>
<b>Professor:</b> I had [name of other Bonehead] in a class
once, and s/he was really cool. By the transitive property of coolness,
I can only assume that you are as well. </p>

the Trombone in NUMB</a></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: 14px; font-style: italic;">Do
I need to provide my own horn? Are there auditions?</p>
<div id="Trombones" style="width: 100%; display: none;">

</div>
<div style="width: 380px; text-align: left; float: left; margin-left: 10px;">
<p style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">What
kind of trombones do you use? Are they provided?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"> We play on large-bore
silver Yamahas that are provided by the NU band office. Everyone gets a
horn and mouthpiece at no charge for the duration of the marching band
season, and through basketball band if you choose to do that too. Most
mouthpieces are comparable to the Bach 6 1/2 in size, although you can
definitely bring your own mouthpiece if you'd like. </p>
<p style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Do I
have to audition?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"> Not to join. We welcome
players of all skill levels. Our section contains people who did
All-State Band/Orchestra, people who started learning during high
school, and everywhere in between.<br>
<br>
We do audition for parts (first and second), but it's not at all
competitive. On the first day of band camp, a graduate assistant hears
everyone individually. The audition is about a minute long usually
consists of two scales and part or all of the fight song. Even after
parts are assigned, it's not a big deal to switch occaisionally.
Sometimes we play pieces with three parts, and sometimes there are
shows with a lot of high notes when some firsts will trade down for a
break. The purpose of the audition is just to ensure we have an equal
amount of players on each part. </p>

</div>
<div style="width: 380px; text-align: left; float: left; margin-left: 10px;">
<p style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">When
does NUMB rehearse?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"> NUMB has 4 weekly
rehearsals plus pre-game practices. The practice times are always the
same: Mon, Wed, Fri 4-6pm, and Thurs 7-9pm. The times are chosen to
avoid as many class conflicts as possible.<br>
<br>
We also have a week-long band camp the week before Wildcat Welcome.
Everyone stays in a dorm together, and meals are provided. </p>
<p style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">How much
does NUMB cost?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"> NUMB is very affordable--
at registration on the first day of band camp, you pay $30. You must
also provide your own black marching shoes.<br>
<br>
The $30 breaks down into $10 for the NUMB shirt of the year, $5 for
white spats, $5 for white gloves, and $10 for the NUMB baseball hat
which we wear in the stands. All of this becomes yours to keep. The
rest of the uniform is provided to you for the duration of the football
season free of charge.<br>
<br>
During the season, there are no costs. Travel, meals, and lodging on
bowl and away game trips, lodging and meals at band camp, and breakfast
before every home game are all provided by the band. </p>
<p style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">How
often does NUMB travel?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"> NUMB travels with the team
once a year to a Big Ten away game, as well as any post-season bowl
game. Recently, NUMB has appeared at the University of Illinois, the
University of Michigan, and the University of Iowa, as well as the
Vitalis Sun Bowl (2005, El Paso, Texas) and the Valero Alamo Bowl
(2008, San Antonio, Texas). </p>
<p style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Am I
guaranteed to march?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"> Yes! Unlike many other
collegiate bands (including multiple Big Ten bands), everyone gets a
spot for every halftime show. Our halftime is always written for the
specific amount of people in our band, which is small enough (usually
about 150 members) that everyone can be on-field at once.<br>
<br>
On occasion, there have been a few people who share a spot for NUMB's
pregame show. This is rare, and in the unlikely event that you're one
of these people, you're guaranteed to march pregame at half of the home
games. </p>
<p style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Can I
get credit for NUMB?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"> For most students, yes,
though the details of this vary from school to school. NUMB is a
half-credit course (a regular class is one credit), and it does count
toward your GPA (hooray!). As with most things, you should double check
with your advisor, but here's how/if each school usually counts it:<br>
<br>
<b>Weinberg:</b> NUMB counts as an elective, so if you do
it for four years, you've gotten 2 of your elective credits taken care
of.<br>
<br>
<b>Medill:</b> Same as Weinberg.<br>
<br>
<b>SESP:</b> Same as Weinberg.<br>
<br>
<b>School of Communications:</b> Doesn't count. Boo.<br>
<br>
<b>Music:</b> Counts as a half-credit music ensemble just
like Symphonic Band, NUCO, SWE, etc.<br>
<br>
<b>Engineering:</b> (copied from <a href="http://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/undergraduate/theme.php">here</a>)
For McCormick, there is something called the "Theme". You must take a
total of 7 courses in three catagories: FAL (Fine Arts, Language,
&amp; Literature), SBS (Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences), and
HSV (Historical Studies &amp; Values). You have two choices... <br>
<br>
In Option A, students take three thematically related courses to form
the focus of their theme. Under this option, three courses must be from
one area (SBS/FAL/HSV), and two courses must come from each of the
other two areas, for a total of seven. These "distribution" classes are
intended to create a well-rounded set of courses.<br>
<br>
Option B allows the student to study a subject more in-depth by taking
five related theme courses and two distribution courses. Under this
option, a maximum of five courses can come from one area (SBS/FAL/HSV),
with two additional courses from one or both of the other areas.<br>
<br>
Marching band counts a 1/2 a credit towards the FAL (Fine Arts,
Language, &amp; Literature). A popular option is to take 4 years of
marching band and one random music class to fulfill the "thematically
related courses" requirement. </p>

Experience</a></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: 14px; font-style: italic;">What
kind of a time commitment is this? Does NUMB travel? What else does
NUMB do?</p>
<div id="NUMB" style="width: 100%; display: none;">

</div>
<div style="width: 380px; text-align: left; float: left; margin-left: 10px;">
<p style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">How much
of a time commitment is NUMB?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"> NUMB rehearses four days a
week for two hours, plus Saturday mornings before home games. Although
it will be your most demanding class physically, the time you spend at
rehearsals is comparable to, say, a science class with a lab component.
The rehearsal schedule is regular and constant, meaning that NUMB
quickly settles into your daily routine and rarely interferes with
extra-curricular activities. </p>
<p style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Is the
atmosphere extremely competitive?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"> No, not at all. Although we
take great pride in what we do, NUMB is a very cooperative
organization, not a competitive one. You don't have to challenge or
audition to get a chance to march halftime or pregame, and you aren't
punished by leadership or directors for errors.<br>
<br>
Instead, NUMB's directors, staff, and student leadership try to help
you and the rest of the band work together to create a good show. As
the smallest band in the Big Ten, we rely on full participation from
every member. </p>
<p style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">I have
little or no experience marching and/or playing. Is this a problem?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"> It's completely fine. No,
really. It is completely, utterly, 100% fine if you don't have
experience, and you won't be alone.<br>
<br>
Every year, NUMB gets several people who have never marched, or who
have at most one parade per year of experience. We've even had people
learn an instrument specifically so they can join. No matter what
you've done before, we'll make sure you learn everything you need to
know and probably more.<br>
<br>
The first day of band camp is dedicated mainly to learning and
practicing basics which we review throughout the rest of band camp and
the season. Even people with experience don't necessarily have
experience in the style that NUMB marches, so don't let a lack of
experience stop you from joining. </p>
<p style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Does
NUMB do anything aside from play at football games?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"> Annually, NUMB hosts "Kids'
Fare: March with the Band" as part of the Bienen School of Music's
Kids' Fare concert series for young children and their families. Think
of it as a music and marching demonstration combined with a NUMB
petting zoo, offering children a chance to interact directly with
musicians and their instruments.<br>
<br>
In addition, NUMB participates in various Homecoming celebrations and
the annual spring football game, as well as additional events hosted by
the Athletic Department. Unofficially, NUMB always has a group in Dance
Marathon (NU's biggest philanthropy) and people often organize groups
to go to away games and root for the 'Cats.<br>
<br>
From time to time, NUMB is asked to play at non-Northwestern events as
well. Recently this has included an appearance on Wheel of Fortune and
at the first-ever Chicago incarnation of the NHL Winter Classic-- a
hockey game played at historic Wrigley Field. </p>
<p style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Does
NUMB ever interact with the football team?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"> Yes! Head Coach Pat
Fitzgerald is a big fan of NUMB, and he encourages the team to spend
time with the band and express their appreciation whenever possible.
Football players (including starting quarterbacks, wide receivers, and
others) regularly make appearances at the band's Thursday night
rehearsals and "spirit sessions," and NUMBers have countless stories of
friendships built with football players on campus and in class.<br>
</p>
<p style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Are
there any perks to joining that I might want to know about...?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"> If there weren't, would we
have included this question? Exactly. As if great calves and having all
travel expenses paid for weren't enough, by joining NUMB you also get
to:<br>
<br>
- Move into University housing the day before everyone else, which
makes life a lot easier and you get to choose which half of the room
you want;<br>
- Be on TV--between the Big Ten network, regular network coverage, and
random things that pop up from time to time, you'll probably be on TV a
fair amount;<br>
- Meet 150 friends the moment you get to campus, who you can ask about
pretty much anything NU/Evanston/college-related since 3/4 of them have
done it all before;<br>
- Join the <a href="http://alumni.northwestern.edu/numbalums/">NUMBALUMS</a>,
a huge network of NU band alums who help each other and help the bands,
after you graduate. </p>
