# Bonehead Website
Official website for the Northwestern University Marching Band Boneheads
## Attention Bonehead Web Developers
In the interest of keeping the Bonehead website from drifting into obscurity, it will henceforth be an 
open source Bonehead project. The site is our baby, and speaking of, perhaps our best shot at increasing 
our numbers in the coming years! All Boneheads are encouraged to contribute.

At first the objective will be to better organize the code and update certain elements that were 
originally intended to be regularly updated. Eventually, we can focus on larger design questions like 
whether we want to add fun little interactive elements and whatnot.

I (Flame) brought the site to GitHub because although it was is intent to give the site a facelift, 
I don't know if I can do it alone. I by no means _expect_ any Boneheads to lend their assistance, but if 
anyone feels like helping, I would greatly appreciate it! Please let me know if you would like to be 
added as a contributer.

Smooches,  
Flame
