You can expect to see a strong alumni showing at Homecoming, and at least a handful of alums dropping in on you at Band Camp, home games, bowl trips, and the occasional rehearsal. In the past, Bonehead alumni have brought us cookies, mailed us babka, and nursed a delirious Bonehead H1N1 influenza patient back to health.</p>
<p>Basically, they&#39;re the greatest people ever, and yet another advantage of being a Bonehead!</p>
<h3>Bonehead Reunion 2014!</h3>
<p>Calling all trombone alumni! The boneheads are hosting their second quinquennial Trombone Reunion at Homecoming 2014. Our first reunion in 2009 saw dozens of attendees, a delicious pizza dinner, and a hard-fought evening of whirleyball, and the section has maintained exemplary attendance at each Homecoming since. If you&rsquo;re not already on the Bonehead listserv, make sure you get the official invite and information by contacting Megan Wines (C15) at <a href="mailto:meganwines2015@u.northwestern.edu">meganwines2015@u.northwestern.edu</a> and Alex Gough (WCAS12) at <a href="mailto:alexgough2007@u.northwestern.edu">alexgough2007@u.northwestern.edu</a>.</p>
<h3>Hey Alumni!</h3>
<p>Did you play trombone in NUMB? Do you want to be more involved and reconnect with fellow trombonists? Hey, we want that too! Here are the four best you can do <em>right now</em>:</p>
<ol>
	<li>If you&#39;re not already, <strong>become a member of the <a href="http://alumni.northwestern.edu/numbalums/">NUMBALUMS</a>!</strong> They&#39;ll update you about official NUMBALUM activities-- Homecoming, High School Band Day, Waa Mu, and more. There are already multiple trombone-playing alumni involved in the leadership of the group, so you know you&#39;ll be taken care of!</li>
	<li><strong>Fill out <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?pli=1&amp;formkey=dGFDMVc0SzhjZFE2QjZNQnZuRGtHeFE6MQ#gid=0">this information form</a>!</strong>&nbsp;Whether you marched at the 1949 Rose Bowl or&nbsp;you endured the Dark Ages of NU football, whether you have a Magic Bonehead Nickname or you predate the use of the word &quot;Bonehead&quot; entirely, we want to hear from you! This information form is a first step to reconnecting and sharing your wisdom with the youngsters who currently march in NUMB.&nbsp;And if you&#39;re on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/nuboneheads">Facebook</a> or <a href="http://www.twitter.com/TheBoneheads">Twitter</a>, you can follow the Boneheads and impart your wisdom there, too!</li>
	<li><strong>Attend Homecoming!</strong> The NUMBALUMS will send you details about how to register if you want to march with the band, and if you fill out that information form in step 2, you&#39;ll hear from a current Bonehead or young alum who&#39;s planning a pre- or post-game trombone gathering.</li>
	<li><strong>Attend the next&nbsp;Bonehead Reunion!</strong> Can&#39;t make it to every Homecoming game? Then aim for a Bonehead Reunion-- a gathering of every Bonehead (past, present, and future)--&nbsp;held every five&nbsp;years at Homecoming. The next one will be in <a href="http://www.facebook.com/events/221056374575271/">2014</a>!</li>
