5|3|Wed, 28 Aug 2013 21:54:41 -0500|Ranking the Most Dangerous Instruments|<p>Well, its more than a year later and we&#39;re gearing up for <strong>Boneheads 2013</strong>. Leadership camp begins on Friday before the full band reports on Sunday, and what a year it is going to be for the &#39;Cats! Following the third 10-win season in Northwestern history and the first bowl victory since the 1949 Rose Bowl, the &#39;Cats return most of their starters for what looks to be a promising year... and we the band will be there!</p><p>Hopefully, assuming things don&#39;t go completely awry, you should be able to follow the Boneheads throughout this season, as we pursue the sweet smell of Roses. So look for a post on that eventually, but tonight, the Boneheads are pleased to announce that one of our own is the star of the 2013 TV promo for the Pat Fitzgerald show as an ill-fated sousaphone! Kumquat is the star of the show, which also features a cameo by yours truly. Take a look...</p><p style="text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/WaFH1LYCOnI" style="z-index: -500" width="560"></iframe></p><p>This inspired tweets like the one from NUHighlights:</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">	<p>If this were June, entire blog posts would be dedicated to ranking marching band instruments on danger posed when falling down.</p>	&mdash; Jon Davis (@NUHighlights) <a href="https://twitter.com/NUHighlights/statuses/372825310162468864">August 28, 2013</a></blockquote><p>This, in turn inspired us: which instruments pose the most danger when falling down? The Boneheads strive to provide you with as much useless nonsense as possible, so here is our ranking of NUMB instruments that make falling the worst.</p><ol>	<li><strong>Drum Major</strong>: You know in <i>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#39;s Stone</i> when they sing the &quot;Hoggy Warty Hogwarts&quot; song at all different tempos? That&#39;s what would happen here. Only in a marching band, that can only end in one way: destruction.</li>	<li><strong>Bass Drum</strong>: The sound of a bass drum falling can cause a sonic boom that will knock out half of the band... and everyone else&#39;s eardrums.</li>	<li><strong>Cymbals</strong>: They&rsquo;ll make a loud clang that throws off the entire band, leaving mass destruction in their wake.</li>	<li><strong>Sousaphone</strong>: As immortalized by the <a href="http://youtu.be/qIpr3fyNm68?t=1m5s" target="_blank">Sousa tumble of 2009</a>, a single sousaphone falling over can have &#39;Catastrophic results.</li>	<li><strong>Trombone</strong>: There&#39;s a reason we dip our horn on double-correct rights.</li>	<li><strong>Flute</strong>: They&#39;re not nearly so long as a trombone, but if a flute player goes down, they will impale you and you will bleed purple and it will not end well for anybody.</li>	<li><strong>Tenor Drum</strong>: Think of them as an oversize load on the highway. If it tips over, and you&#39;re next to it, you&#39;re squished.</li>	<li><strong>Baritone</strong>: Let&#39;s just say they&#39;ve had their share of damage-inducing accidents over the past couple of years... and sometimes, it looks like a truck ran over it, per Mr. Farris. And trucks, they&#39;re pretty destructive. Just not as much as oversized trucks. So you lose to the tenor drums.</li>	<li><strong>Mellophone</strong>: It&#39;s like a baritone, only smaller. And you guys managed to wreck three in one week once. Maybe that makes you guys like the Hot Wheels of this truck trifecta?</li>	<li><strong>Trumpet</strong>: One of my favourite pregame runthroughs involved a trumpet screaming after he forgot about the sudden &lsquo;bout face during Go U and shrieked. There could have been all sorts of carnage there&hellip; teeth&hellip; someone&rsquo;s head&hellip;</li>	<li><strong>Tenor Sax</strong>: It is big&hellip; and curvy&hellip; and would hurt if it hit you on the head.</li>	<li><strong>Alto Sax</strong>: It is small&hellip; and curvy&hellip; but would still hurt if it hit you on the head.</li>	<li><strong>Snare Drum</strong>: If you&#39;ve never tried poking yourself in the eye, you&#39;re missing out on a painful experience that we do not encourage trying. But if a snare drummer trips and their drumsticks go flying, that is exactly what could happen to you!</li>	<li><strong>Piccolo</strong>: Rumour has it that the piccolo is known to the state of California to cause choking. And that&#39;s exactly what could happen if someone trips, sends the piccolo flying, and it flies into your mouth.</li>	<li><strong>Clarinet</strong>: (Insert never seen, never heard joke)</li></ol><p>Go &#39;Cats!</p><p>-The Vespanator</p>
