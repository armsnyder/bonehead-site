<p>In high school, I played trombone in marching band for two
years before moving out of the country where marching band was not
available. I knew I wanted to join the marching band in college, but I
was a bit apprehensive due to my self-perceived low skill level and the
fact that I hadn't marched for two years. Also, I had heard how
competitive marching bands were in the Big Ten and I was definitely
afraid that I wouldn't be up to par both playing and marching.</p>
<p>Although I practiced some over the summer prior to my freshman
year after the music and information about band camp were sent out, I
was very much clueless and still really had no idea how to play the
fight song, let alone anything else. And I was expecting to get run off
of the field at band camp and was afraid I wouldn't get the chance to
perform if I failed at a tryout.</p>
<p>But, when I showed up to campus to report for band camp, I
found an exciting and entertaining group of people very much willing to
include everyone in the organization and to teach everyone how to play
and march. There were many in NUMB that never marched or even played
that specific instrument before, and there was a lot of help available
for everyone to improve. And, to my surprise, I picked up both the
playing and the marching much quicker than I thought and everyone had
the chance to march. The band wasn't competitive at all and instead was
a great group atmosphere that promoted helping everyone learn and
progress.</p>
<p>It was also the most fun and the best way to meet people
entering college. Before classes even started, I had about 150 friends
and something to get excited about every week as we performed for all
of the home games and one away game. It also helped fuel my love for
college football and made Northwestern my favorite team (by far). And,
even after I've graduated, it's still one thing I'll never regret and
would do again in a heartbeat.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: 14px; font-style: italic;">"I
wasn't sure what I wanted to do, but I was pretty sure marching band
wasn't for me. Boy, did I underestimate NUMB."<br>

<p>I didn't intend to join marching band. I was definitely a band
geek in high school, but marching band was my least favorite ensemble.
I'd been playing trombone since 5th grade and I wanted to keep playing
in college, but I was unclear as to how the whole audition process for
the various ensembles worked, especially at a university with such an
intimidatingly awesome music school. I wasn't sure what I wanted to do,
but I was pretty sure marching band wasn't for me.</p>
<p>Boy, did I underestimate NUMB.</p>
<p>I had this mailing that said the marching band didn't require
auditions, and it would only be fall quarter. I swallowed my worries,
told myself it would be a good way to get my foot in the door, and
signed up.</p>
<p>I reported to Evanston for band camp, and I was terrified.
After all, this was my first day at college, and it was marching band
camp, and I'm not really the best trombone player (or marcher) around.
I had no idea what I was getting myself into. But within hours of that
first day, I was put completely at ease. The people, the passion, the
amazing spirit that surrounds NUMB are unmatched. The boneheads in
particular are the most wacky, friendly, loving group around; I felt
like I had 15 older brothers and sisters, which is incredibly
comforting to a floundering freshman trying to figure out what the hell
she's doing.</p>
<p>I did go on to join other ensembles, including the music
sorority and its jazz band, but they all took a backseat to the fun I
was having in NUMB. I even ended up being elected Spirit Leader for two
of my four years in the band. The moral of the story: No matter why
you're skeptical, give NUMB a chance. Even if you decide it's not for
you, you'll never regret it, you'll have a great time, and you'll meet
some of your best friends of college -- and life.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: 14px; font-style: italic;">"My
time in NUMB has defined my experience at Northwestern."</p>
<div id="Dozer" style="width: 100%;">
<p>Band was a big part of my life in high school. Marching band,
pep band, jazz band, concert and symphonic bands-- I did it all. I
wasn't ever very good at it, but it was the common element in almost
all of my friendships. As the only student from my high school to go to
Northwestern, I was a little worried about losing my regular social
interaction. I joined NUMB in hopes of forging the same kinds of social
connections I had in high school.</p>
<p>That happened-- thanks to NUMB, I've made a lot of great and
lasting friendships-- but something else unexpected happened, too. More
than just a thing to do, or a way to make friends, or a way to keep
playing music, marching band has made me appreciate the amazing place
I'm at more than I would have otherwise. My time in NUMB has defined my
experience at Northwestern.</p>
<p>In NUMB, I've started to see just what it is that makes
Northwestern special. I've seen athletes on the field who are genuine
scholars in the classroom, defying the conventional wisdom that
football players have to be dumb. I've met talented musicians who spend
their time in chemistry labs. I've seen the best of Northwestern, with
some the most talented people the university has to offer.</p>
<p>No matter what you choose to do at Northwestern, you'll
probably have an amazing time. But the view that NUMB gives you really
is something unique, and something I'm not doing justice. I wouldn't
trade my time in NUMB for anything.</p>
