and Traditions<br>
<span style="font-size: 18px;">The Boneheads do more than
just play the trombone...</span> </p>
</div>
<div id="MainText" style="padding: 25px; width: auto;">
<p>The Boneheads have a proud history and a fascinating set of
traditions within and separate from NUMB. No single web page could ever
hope to fully document these traditions, which are constantly evolving
as new members join and leave their mark on the section. Even so, here
are some highlights of the Boneheads' section culture:</p>
<b><span style="font-size: x-large;">Pride &amp;
Guts</span></b><br>
<a href="regent-growl.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img src="regent-growl.jpg" border="0" height="133" width="200"></a> Central to all of NUMB, "P&amp;G"
best describes how the band approaches its work. We take pride in our
music, our drill, our school, and our team, and we approach everything
we do with guts, aiming for perfection. There are no fans louder and
more dedicated than the members of the Northwestern University Marching
Band.&nbsp;The Boneheads have embraced this mantra, defining a
large part of the section culture. We strive to be the loudest section
of the band, encouraging those around us even when the "Cardiac 'Cats"
test our faith.<br>
<br>
As evidence of this, Boneheads have been well-represented on NUMB's
SpiriTeam (TM) for as long as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwestern_University_Wildcat_Marching_Band#The_SpiriTeam">Wikipedia</a>
has been keeping records.&nbsp;Boneheads have accounted for
nearly&nbsp;<b>one-third</b>&nbsp;of&nbsp;the
Spirit Leaders, Grynders, and official Band Geeks identified since 1975
that keep the band excited and lead the cheers in the stands.<br>
<br>
<b><span style="font-size: x-large;">The Bonehead
Flag</span></b><br>
<a href="http://groups.northwestern.edu/boneheads/mini.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img src="http://groups.northwestern.edu/boneheads/mini.jpg" border="0" height="142" width="200"></a>
Central to our identity as a section, the flag serves as our emblem in
all things that we do. At the center of the black flag is a shield and
sword colored with purple, white, and gold, with "BONEHEADS" and "9th"
appearing in white lettering.<br>
<br>
Want to know the deep symbolism behind the colors, the crest, and the
number? Well, sorry, but there isn't really any that we know of. It has
purple and white, obviously, and dark gold makes a good color for a
sword, don't you think? <br>
<br>
Even though the design doesn't allude to the mythical deeds of our
Bonehead forebearers, the flag still represents the awesomeness that is
our section. We display it at appropriate times, march around with it
occasionally, and take it with us on some trips. Other sections are
always trying to steal it, and for that reason, the flag is passed down
only to the Bonehead who is strongest and most capable of keeping it
safe.<br>
<br>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"> <a href="http://groups.northwestern.edu/boneheads/flag_with_gelato.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img src="http://groups.northwestern.edu/boneheads/flag_with_gelato.jpg" border="0" height="200" width="132"></a><br>
</div>
Created by a Bonehead's mother for a military-themed band camp in 1999,
the flag has been passed on to the guardianship of the strongest and
most able Boneheads. They are sworn to protect it and keep it safe. Yet
even the strongest among us is only human, and the flag has been stolen
at various points in its history. Once, a theft resulted in the flag
going on a grand adventure, including stops with the Naked Cowboy in
New York and various places in Italy. Like the traveling gnome in <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Am%C3%A9lie">Amélie</a></i>,
the flag has represented the Boneheads around the world.<br>
<br>
Thus began the continuing journeys of the flag, spreading the Bonehead
name throughout the globe. From Big Ten schools to the Large Hadron
Collider, the flag has puzzled and amused literally tens of people
around the world. Click here to see where in the world the Bonehead
flag has been.<br>

<b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">Section Relics</span></b><br>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"> <a href="deanrat.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img src="deanrat.jpg" border="0" height="133" width="200"></a><br>
</div>
Like the flag, the Boneheads boast a wide variety of "relics"--
important items passed on from one generation of Boneheads to the next,
each carrying a story. There's the bowling ball found in the street on
an unofficial trip to Indiana University, "Dean Rat" (an animatronic
rat who miraculously came back to life during the 2008 season), the
official Emergency Kit, and several other significant artifacts that
have somehow come into possession of the Boneheads.<br>
<br>
The eclectic mix of relics serve as a symbolic link to decades of
Bonehead alumni, many of whom stay in close contact with the current
section. The Boneheads have a proud history and tradition which lives
on through these shared objects.<br>
<br>
<b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">The Listserv</span></b><br>
While not technically a tradition, the Bonehead Listserv is the
incubator for much of the section's identity. Through this closed
e-mail forum, current members and alumni discuss football, music,
current events, and literally everything else in the universe. You
never know when your inbox may receive an inspiring YouTube video, a
hilarious (and unconventional) take on the history of the Electoral
College, the latest installment of a conversation that first started in
2005, or lengthy speculation on post-season bowl possibilities.<br>
<br>
And every now and then, the listserv is used to distribute important
information and plan events.<br>
<br>
(If you're an alum who happened upon this website and you're looking to
reconnect on the listserv, <a href="mailto:NUMB.Boneheads@gmail.com">e-mail
us</a>!)<br>
<br>
<b><span style="font-size: x-large;">Bonehead Bowl</span></b><br>
December and January are often associated with a post-season bowl game
for the 'Cats, but there's another winter football game which is nearly
as important: the <b>Bonehead Bowl</b>.<br>
<br>
The Trombones vs. the World football game is held on the night with the
first significant snowfall at Northwestern's <a href="http://maps.northwestern.edu/#latlngz=42.0529191721614%2C-87.676398307085%2C18&amp;lookupid=350&amp;showlist=">Deering
Meadow</a>. There, our speed, athleticism, and agility are put to
the test against opponents ranging from other sections to actual
athletes. And who knows when a Northwestern football player might drop
by...<br>
<br>
<b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">Section Dinners</span></b><br>
After rehearsals during marching season and once a week during the rest
of the school year, the Boneheads tend to eat together. Although clubs,
sports, and other conflicts often make it difficult to guarantee full
attendance, these meals give us a chance to bond in a setting that
doesn't involve marching around and playing the trombone. In addition,
continuing these dinners throughout the school year gives everyone a
chance to stay in touch with fellow Boneheads. When you've got majors
ranging from engineering to philosophy to music, this is incredibly
valuable.<br>
<br>
<b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">Crazy Adventures</span></b><br>
<a href="whirlyball.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img src="whirlyball.jpg" border="0" height="133" width="200"></a> Beyond the normal annual traditions,
the Boneheads strive to add new and exciting activities and adventures
every year. Celebrating <a href="http://www.trombone.net/itw/">International
Trombone Week</a>&nbsp;with a trip to Krispy Kreme,
late-night Nintendo Wii parties, and an evening of fine dining and <a href="http://www.whirlyball.com/home/index.php">Whirlyball</a>
are all par for the course. If you enjoy fun, the Boneheads are the
section for you!<br>
